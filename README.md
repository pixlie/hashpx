Opinionated playbooks to build full-stack, user-facing software products

## Hey Founders, Designers, and Developers!
Do you want to build full-stack apps with single page frontends (web and native) at blazing speed, keeping an eye on the recent and best software practices?

Well, we want to do that too! That is why we started **hashpx**. We compile years of experience from our own team and lots of other brilliant people in the software industry to give you playbooks to kickstart your next dream product. If you are already in a software product lifecycle then you might want to add our playbooks as power packs to your existing thought process.

## Context
We are focused on **rapid development**, **measurement of impact** and **quick product iteration**. That means our playbooks are geared towards founders (+ product managers/owners), designers and developers.

We want to help all young software product teams get started and stay agile in their first 6 - 24 months of product development cycle, which is a very crucial period. Our thoughts will apply if you are building full-stack user-facing software products.

We keep in mind the following **contexts** that apply to you:
- You want to focus on their core value proposition
- Writing software is not a critical differentiator in your product
- Starting and iterating quickly is key in your product
- You want to focus on your customers and product features
- You want to adhere to recent and best software practices/choices

We are **opinionated** - our focus will include:
- Agile as the character of your team
- Lean development - learn, deliver early, empower your team, measure, iterate
- Choice of Asana, Trello or JIRA or other project management tools
- Frontend stack with JavaScript (ES2015, React, Redux, React Router, etc.)
- Backend stack with Python (Sanic/Tornado, Marshmallow, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Use as many tools/methodologies to boost your productivity as possible, CI/CD for example
- Quick setup of infrastructure, on AWS, Heroku for example
- TDD for at least core business logic

## For founders
We assume non-technical or semi-technical founders, who want to stay lean. Like someone said - "Agile is dead, long live agility". It is a culture, and we maintain it with daily practices and support from tools.

As we are building **hashpx** ourselves, some of the playbooks will be missing, if you need help at any point, just reach us through Github.

## For designers
We encourage you to embrace the single page app stack as much as possible. If you are awesome at HTML and CSS, you are already there. We will make it really easy for you to contribute your visual designs straight into a ReactJS skeleton app, enabling you to build working prototypes without involving a developer.

## For developers
The right project setup is the only the first step. There is so much happening in the web and app development scene right now that it is easy to get lost in the noise. And some stacks like React are fairly moving targets, lots of things are evolving regularly. We spend hours daily to churn through these and give you actionable opinions. Oh and tons of code samples. Again, our stack is Python (Tornado/Sanic, Marshmallow, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL) based thin RESTful API backend with JavaScript (ES2015, React, React Native, Redux, React Router). For background tasks that can be decoupled from the web stack, we prefer using RabbitMQ with Python consumers.

## Build on the shoulders of giants
Tons of tools, open source software exist to make your next product awesome. We make some of the opinions, but you are free to always counter us. Let's get this shit done!
